                menu bloat. Large menus with dozens and dozens of items create indecision for customers and invite increased performance </p>

            <p>A side of salmon, hot off the grill and laid on fig leaves from a backyard tree if you have one, makes a spectacular main course. If you're daunted by the prospect of flipping such a large piece of fish, cut it into three sections before grilling

                <p>Selecting my favorite foreign cuisine is a difficult task. I'm obsessed with a lot of different cuisines, but Indian food is definitely at the top of the list. It showcases so many wonderful spices and flavors that can range significantly
